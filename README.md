# February 2018 First meeting

[Here are the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NTPZCPLHcQTjz8u_o3n9lVqX_WWQ9SZ_CYSEcLv29To)

## Equipment

A purchase request for 3 more Vive based VR setups will be sent in the next few days. It will allow more people to develop and run experiments at the same time.

## Development workspace

Currently ~8 MAT PhDs use VR for their studies. They are scattered around the engineering and the CS buildings, causing VR development to be slow and problematic:

- We need to move the equipment around and setup it every time, even for minor tasks.
- At least 3 of us work on multiparty projects, and move even more resources around, usually for short periods of time during development.
- Students that use room scale VR (physically moving around the room with the headset) bump into their peers in the office, who are not VR people, making the office less comfortable to work in.

To solve this issues we would like to get a space of 4 desks, together, dedicated for VR development. PCs won’t move around anymore, and testing multiparty scenarios will require a few minutes help from a nearby colleague. Also as we all do VR development we won’t interrupt unrelated students when testing room scale scenarios.
Because most of the MAT VR people belong to the CogSci group we are checking the possibility to get these 4 desks in the new CS400 open space, plus, ideally, 4 more nearby desks so all of the 8 students will sit together, so swapping places will be easy.

## Expectations/plans for future meetings and the group in general

- Angela: It’s hard to keep up to date in the field. Tom G: To solve that people need to go out and come with news to share.
- Consider arranging a visit to the digital catapult. They might have interesting things to showcase.
- Shivani and Tom D: It might be useful to talk about our WIP projects.
- We can discuss problems we find, hoping that they are common and someone already solved them.
- A VR workshop by Tom D.
- Shivani might talk about a 360 film she is working on.

## Group admin and communication
To keep the admin low we will start with this google doc and monthly invitations through the residents@lists.eecs.qmul.ac.uk list.

Suggested alternatives:

- groups.io
- Github Wiki
- Slack (an existing channel)

# Upcoming XR Events

+ [VR Diversity Initiative Kick-Off! event](https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/02/vr-diversity-initiative-launches-2018-campaign/). The initiative aims to make the VR industry more inclusive by introducing XR technologies such as VR/AR and MR through free one-day workshops to under-represented groups. It will be the first of 6 VR Diversity Initiative events running in 2018. 28th February 2018, at Here East, [Hobbs Studio](https://hobsstudio.com/). Contact Tom D if you want direct contact info.
+ [Wearable technology show](http://www.wearabletechnologyshow.net/), early March
